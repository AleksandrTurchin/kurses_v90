My home town is small. It is rich in parks and gardens, so it is very green.
The town stands on the river and from the bridges you can have a nice view of its beautiful houses.
In the center there are mainly old buildings and a church. There is no theatre in my town but there is a museum.
The museum is not far from the main square.

The streets of my town are narrow and the houses are not very high.
There are many small corner shops where people usually buy food.
Also there is a market where people can buy fresh fruits and vegetables.

My home town is not very famous but I am proud of it.
